I think we've all seen [this scene](https://youtu.be/u1h8cHUnP9k?t=132) in The Simpsons, and if you haven't then make sure you do watch it as it is a fan fave. *Aurora Borealis*, more commonly known as the Northern Lights, is the big shiny cosmic display of colors that happens in the northern reaches of the planet. Fun fact: in the southern hemisphere the same light display does happen but is called *Aurora Australis*, and the general name for both the northern and southern lights is *Aurora Polaris*. Many people have "See the Northern Lights" on their bucket list, fewer actually go out to hunt them, and even fewer yet succeed. That being said, they are not exactly elusive and in this post I'll try to give you a run down of some tips and general knowhow that will help you achieve that one "checkbox" in your life.

## Location, location, location

The Northern Lights are thusly called because they happen in the Northern reaches of the planet. Let's back up for a very quick re-cap of what the Northern lights actually are, courtesy of the Library of Congress website:

> The origin of the aurora begins on the surface of the sun when solar activity ejects a cloud of gas. Scientists call this a coronal mass ejection (CME). If one of these reaches earth, taking about 2 to 3 days, it collides with the Earth’s magnetic field. This field is invisible, and if you could see its shape, it would make Earth look like a comet with a long magnetic ‘tail’ stretching a million miles behind Earth in the opposite direction of the sun.

> When a coronal mass ejection collides with the magnetic field, it causes complex changes to happen to the magnetic tail region. These changes generate currents of charged particles, which then flow along lines of magnetic force into the Polar Regions. These particles are boosted in energy in Earth’s upper atmosphere, and when they collide with oxygen and nitrogen atoms, they produce dazzling auroral light.

We've long heard about Iceland being a fantastic travel destination that is a must-do on the bucketlist. From fantastic waterfalls, to rugged ocean-side cliffs, to the ice caves and more there's lots to see in Iceland. Then, one day we noticed a deal from [TravelZoo](https://www.travelzoo.com/ca/) that seemed too good to pass up - $600 CAD for a flight and hotel combo in Reykjavik. The thing is, at least part of the reason why it was so cheap was because the available dates were during the middle of the winter. We debated if it's worth it but among the biggest "pros" of going to Iceland in the winter was the idea of having a high chance of seeing the Northern Lights, *Aurora Borealis*. So in January 2016 we booked our tickets for the middle of February, packed our bags, and off we went.
