I think we've all seen [this scene](https://youtu.be/u1h8cHUnP9k?t=132) in The Simpsons, and if you haven't then make sure you do watch it as it is a fan fave. *Aurora Borealis*, more commonly known as the Northern Lights, is the big shiny cosmic display of colors that happens in the northern reaches of the planet. Fun fact: in the southern hemisphere the same light display does happen but is called *Aurora Australis*, and the general name for both the northern and southern lights is *Aurora Polaris*. Many people have "See the Northern Lights" on their bucket list, fewer actually go out to hunt them, and even fewer yet succeed. That being said, they are not exactly elusive and in this post I'll try to give you a run down of some tips and general knowhow that will help you achieve that one "checkbox" in your life.

## Location, location, location

The Northern Lights are thusly called because they happen in the Northern reaches of the planet. Let's back up for a very quick re-cap of what the Northern lights actually are, courtesy of the Library of Congress website:

> The origin of the aurora begins on the surface of the sun when solar activity ejects a cloud of gas. Scientists call this a coronal mass ejection (CME). If one of these reaches earth, taking about 2 to 3 days, it collides with the Earth’s magnetic field. This field is invisible, and if you could see its shape, it would make Earth look like a comet with a long magnetic ‘tail’ stretching a million miles behind Earth in the opposite direction of the sun.

> When a coronal mass ejection collides with the magnetic field, it causes complex changes to happen to the magnetic tail region. These changes generate currents of charged particles, which then flow along lines of magnetic force into the Polar Regions. These particles are boosted in energy in Earth’s upper atmosphere, and when they collide with oxygen and nitrogen atoms, they produce dazzling auroral light.

So a few things of note: Firstly, auroras have more to do with the sun occasionally having increased solar activity than anything to do with the Earth. Secondly, the "Earth" part of this equation has to do only with the ever-present magnetic field that does not change its activity due to seasons or factors you'd be able to see on a human scale. Finally, since the ionized particles flow along the lines of the magnetic field, it makes sense that they'd be visible around where that magnetic field intersects the atmosphere rather than where that magnetic field is in the vacuum of space.

So the closer you go towards the North or South poles, the better your vantage point *if* the solar activity strikes earther.

## Winter is coming

We've long heard about Iceland being a fantastic travel destination that is a must-do on the bucketlist. From fantastic waterfalls, to rugged ocean-side cliffs, to the ice caves and more there's lots to see in Iceland. Then, one day we noticed a deal from [TravelZoo](https://www.travelzoo.com/ca/) that seemed too good to pass up - $600 CAD for a flight and hotel combo in Reykjavik. The thing is, at least part of the reason why it was so cheap was because the available dates were during the middle of the winter. We debated if it's worth it but among the biggest "pros" of going to Iceland in the winter was the idea of having a high chance of seeing the Northern Lights. So in January 2016 we booked our tickets for the middle of February, packed our bags, and off we went.

So why does it matter if it's winter or not? If the sole variable that affects whether our atmosphere is ionized depends on whether or not the Sun farts into space then why would the seasons change anything? Well, the truth is that it doesn't - CMEs happen regardless of our sesasons, but the problem is that if the air is ionized during daytime, the bright light of the Sun will completely drown out the aurora and make it invisible to the human eye. You know when there's generally less sunlight around? That's right... during winter! So trying to view the aurora during the long winter nights gives you more chances (more hours in the day) to see it.

## It's raining, it's pouring

... blah blah blah you can't see auroras if there's clouds ...
