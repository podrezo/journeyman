I want to share two really interesting websites I came across. The first one is [Google Treks](https://www.google.com/maps/about/treks/#/grid) - there are street-view style 360 photos with commentary and stories behind them. A lot of the treks read like a National Geographic article. My favorites so far are [Petra](https://www.google.com/maps/about/behind-the-scenes/streetview/treks/petra/) and the [Savannah in Kenya](https://www.google.com/maps/about/behind-the-scenes/streetview/treks/samburu-kenya/).

The other site I want to show you is one of my friend showed me called [GeoGuessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/). This one lets you see various places around the world and then guess where they are, collecting points depending on proximity.

Have fun!
