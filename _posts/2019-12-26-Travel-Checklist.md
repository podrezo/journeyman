Every time I leave for a trip, I find myself running in cirlces wondering what I forgot. To this end, I've been maintaing a travel checklist of items that are musts and figured I'd share what's in my suitcase when I travel. Let's get started!

# General

These are items that you're probably going to want to bring on every trip, regardless of where you're going.

* T-Shirts
* Socks
* Underwear
* Sleeping undershirts
* Hat
* Meds
  * Any perscription meds you're taking
  * Medicine for upset stomachs, headaches, allergies
* Towel ("Don't forget to bring a towel!" &ndash; Towelie)
* Toiletries
  * Toothbrush & toothpaste
  * Shampoo
  * Body wash
  * Loofa
  * Comb
  * Moisturizer
* Umbrella and/or Rain Jacket
* Camera
* Gadgets and chargers

# Situational

Depending on if you're going on a business trip, a vacation, or something else you may need these

* Formal or dressy clothes
  * Collared shirts
  * Dress pants
* Hiking and/or waterproof shoes

# Warm weather üòé 

Heading to the beach or out for long summer hikes? You'll probably want

* Sunglasses
* Flip flops and/or Sandals
* Swim suit
* Shorts

 
# Cold weather ‚ùÑÔ∏è

If instead you're heading for some winter adventures you may want

* Warm clothes
  * Scarf
  * Gloves/mittens
  * Wool socks
  * Underlayers

# Out of the country

* Passport
* Physical itinerary (It's great we have devices, but batteries die and screens crack. Better safe than sorry!)

# Nice-to-haves

* Entertainment (a book or a magazine?)
* Power bank for on-the-go charging
* Snacks

I'll be modifying this list every so often and expanding it as I think of more things that I may have missed. Hope that helps!
